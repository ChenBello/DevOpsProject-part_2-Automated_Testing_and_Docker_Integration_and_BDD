1. Fastapi application that runs Python test scripts against our Spring Boot server.
2. Test Execution: Python tests that run and interact with the Spring Boot server, verifying its “logging” functionality using multiple unit tests. 
3. Docker Setup: pushed both parts of the project in the same Docker container.
4. BDD(bonus): This is a software development process that emphasizes collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical participants in a software project.
